# IDEAS:
Shrek needs to finish an assignment but everyone is getting in the way of it in a way that is unique to the Shrek characters. Eg. Donkey is just being annoying, Puss in boots is being unnecessarily cryptic, Gingerbread man is scared of something, dragon is unintelligible but annoyed, etc.

What if when Shrek gets mad, the gingerbread man poops little sprinkles (like in the movie) because heâ€™s scared lol
	
While Shrek is trying to work on his assignment, Fiona could be calling for him over and over. Lord Farquaad could just be a sneaky robot? Have him pop his head or walk behind everyone without anyone noticing. Prince Charming could be with him (if we want to add him?) ? 

What if in the end we make it really cheesy and let them sing a song together about teamwork and stuff? Like the little puppets did in the second movie? 



# CHARACTERS (could be reduced as needed):

Donkey

That one witch that gave him the potion? Could she be involved in this story somehow, maybe he went to her for help which caused a problem?
