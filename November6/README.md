# nRF+Music Shield
Since we don't have an amplifier, we instead use our earphone to examine whether our work is working properly.

And it works pretty well! We can hear the musics, the only thing is that we have two tracks in the sd card, yet we can only play the first one but not the second one. We may find a way to figure this out later (maybe ask Professor about it)
